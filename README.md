# time-convertor

This is based on two concepts:
A) Inputting time in minutes and converting into hours/days as applicable.
B) Time conversion across various time zones. The available time zones are GMT(Greenwich mean time), IST(Indian Standard Time), EDT(Eastern Daylight Time) and CST(Central Standard Time). So inputting that, the program asks for the local time in the respective time-zone and then converts it into the others.
